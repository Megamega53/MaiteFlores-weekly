### Working in Open Source  
**Benefits of contributing to Open Source projects** 
  
Two ways that I would like to contribute to an Open Source Project are 1) to help find bugs and 2) to translate code to other languages. I prefer the projects to be written in C++ because I am most familiar with this language. I think finding bugs and translating code is a good start for someone like me who has never contributed to an Open Source project before. I believe that contributing in these ways will also help me gain the confidence to make more contributions in bigger and better ways.

Working in Open Source provides various benefits. For me personally, it would allow me to further improve my communication skills, as I would have to work with various people, possibly from different parts of the world, which requires exceptional communication skills. Furthermore, participating in Open Source projects would allow me to pick up new skills as I would be able to read more and different code. Open Source projects have contributors with different skill levels and there are always opportunities to learn from others, whether it be something I forgot because I don’t use it often, or a new form of code that I haven’t seen before. Not to mention, participating in Open Source projects allow me to improve my coding skills through seeing other people’s code and allowing me to code on a regular basis.

In the long run, participating in Open Source projects benefit both my career and personal network. Not only would I have the opportunity to interact with new people repeatedly, but I would also have the opportunity to build new friendships and possibly start my own personal project with some of these people. On a professional level, I will be able to include a few of these projects in my portfolio to show to future employers and incorporate the skills I picked up along the way into my new job.
