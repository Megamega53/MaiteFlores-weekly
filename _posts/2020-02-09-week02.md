### Working in Open Source  
**Benefits of contributing to Open Source projects** 
  
Two ways that I would like to contribute to an Open Source Project are: 
  1. help find bugs 
   1. translate code to other languages.  
  
 I prefer the projects to be written in C++ because I am most familiar with this language. I think finding bugs and translating code is a good start for someone like me who has never contributed to an Open Source project before. I believe that contributing in these ways will also help me gain the confidence to make more contributions in bigger and better ways.

Working in Open Source provides various benefits. Participating in an OSS community would help me improve my communication skills. I would have to work with various people from different parts of the world. Furthermore, I would pick up new skills such as writing good code and documentation. Open Source projects have contributors with different skill levels and there are always opportunities to learn from others. Whether it be something I forgot because I don’t use it often, or a new form of code that I haven’t seen before I can always learn something new. Lastly, participating in Open Source projects would improve my coding skills by viewing other people’s code and coding based on best practices.

In the long run, participating in Open Source projects benefits both my career and personal network. Not only would I have the opportunity to interact with new people repeatedly, but I would also have the opportunity to build new friendships and possibly start my own personal project with some of these people. On a professional level, I would be able to include a few of these projects in my portfolio to show to future employers and incorporate the skills I picked up along the way into my new job.
