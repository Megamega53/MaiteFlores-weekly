### Project Activities

##### 3/14/2020

This week, my group has slowly made progress on this project. One of the biggest issues we were having is finding an issue for
us to contribute to. What we found while going through the issues is that they were either in progress or the ones that were
available had been abandoned multiple times. Since many issues were abandoned multiple times it felt intimidating since we
didn’t know if we would be able to solve the issue. After a while of trying to find an issue, we settled on
[one](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/12249).

##### 3/15/2020
The issue we chose turned out to be completed. When my group member Christina went through the issue once again before
cloning, she found that in the comment section the issue had been solved. So we had to start again. The
[new issue](https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/3938) we chose asks us to show a pointer every time a user hovers over
the message being edited and when clicking allows the user to compose. With a new issue chosen we moved on to cloning to our
machines, which I do admit should have been the first thing we did. [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) has some very
clear [instructions](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development/setup-vagrant.html#macos) as to how to clone to a
personal machine. We had to download two prerequisites, [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and
[VitualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). While it was easy to download and install Vagrant, VirtualBox quickly
became annoying to install as I kept getting “Error installing” with no explanation as to what was wrong. After some frantic
clicking, some near mental breakdowns and three Youtube tutorials later ([1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEvM-No4eQo),
[2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNV5JmxtKP4),[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQwdu7DQiHU)) I finally got VirtualBox
installed. I was finally ready to move on. Little did I know, it would take forever to run
> cd zulip  
  vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest  
  vagrant up --provider=virtualbox

on my terminal. As of when this was written, my terminal is still running the third command…

### Open Source is Not About You

While reading the article [Open Source is Not About You](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9)
I completely agreed with the author Rich. While I wasn’t aware that people felt entitled to certain privileges or say
regarding a project, I do agree that as a user or contributor you shouldn’t expect a project or the people running the project
to bend to your needs. Open source projects are amazing as they gracefully provide the general population with free software
to both use and modify. If a user or contributor wants an open source project to be one way as opposed to
another, they have the ability to start their own project and make it do whatever they desire. The people who 100% have a say
as to what is done with a particular project are the people running it as they are the ones who brought this project to life
and have possibly sacrificed a lot to do so.

This week I added a family friend's laundromat to openstreetmap. In addition to this, I added a supermarket that I and many
other locals frequented in my old neighbothood.
