My name is **Maite** and I have been coding for about _three_ years now. My first coding language was _HTML_ but now I 
mostly code in _C++_. Some of the coding languages that I know include:
* C++ 
* CSS
* HTML
* Python <- _although I am not the best as coding in Python I am working on improving my skills_ 

### More Information

* I am fluent in two languages **English** and **Spanish** with Spanish being my first language 
* _Fun Fact_: When I was about 17 with not much to do, I taught myself the korean alphabet and now I can still 
somewhat read Korean without knowing or understading a single word.
