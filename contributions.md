|  2   | [Updated the name and fixed the address for the selected region](https://www.openstreetmap.org/changeset/81063467)    | openstreetmap|When looking through my old neighborhood I realized that a store that had been in that location was not included in the map and the address for the building was the address for a building across the street. By scrolling through the official website for the store chain I was able to find the official address for that given store and include the name of the autoparts store.|

The address at the selected location had two addresses so I went to the official website for this clinic and used the address provided. |
